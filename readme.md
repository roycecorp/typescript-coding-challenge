Included are two api functions, listPets and listPeople, that return a list of pets and people respectively. 

You must create a program, either as command line node application or a web app, that does the following.

1. Displays data from each list.
2. The user can select a person or pet and view information about them.
3. Allow the user to search for a particular name or person.  Fetch the data from the api each time.
4. Allow the user to create 'register' a pet to a person. Create a record with the id of the pet and the person and store it either in memory or in a json file.  
5. Create an 'api' function that retrieves the records of pet ownership, when a user selects a person or pet, also display corresponding owner(s) of that pet or corresponding pets owned by that person.
